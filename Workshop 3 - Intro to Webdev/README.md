# Intro to Web Development Workshop

Welcome to the **Intro to Web Development Workshop**! In this session, weâ€™ll cover the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing you with the skills to build a simple, interactive profile card as a mini-project. This `README` summarizes the main points and code examples for each section.

## 1. Introduction to Web Development

Web development is the process of creating and maintaining websites, split into **front-end** (client-side) and **back-end** (server-side) development. Weâ€™ll focus on front-end development, which includes:

- **HTML**: Defines the structure of web pages.
- **CSS**: Styles the appearance of web pages.
- **JavaScript**: Adds interactivity and functionality to web pages.

**How the Web Works**:
- **Client-Server Model**: Clients (browsers) request content from servers, which send HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to be rendered by the browser.
- **Request-Response Cycle**: Understanding this process helps in developing web applications effectively.

## 2. HTML: Structuring the Web

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the foundation of web structure, using tags to define elements on a page.

### Basic Syntax
- **Tags**: Elements like `<p>`, `<a>`, `<img>`, `<ul>`, `<h1>`, and `<div>` create content and structure.
- **Attributes**: Provide additional information to elements (e.g., `src` for images, `href` for links).

### Example Structure
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>My Bio Page</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Welcome to My Bio Page</h1>
  <section>
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello! My name is Alex, and I'm learning web development.</p>
  </section>
</body>
</html>
```

## 3. CSS: Styling the Web

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) styles HTML content by defining colors, fonts, layouts, and spacing.

### Adding CSS
- **Inline CSS**: Directly within an HTML tag (`<p style="color: blue;">`).
- **Internal CSS**: Inside a `<style>` tag in the `<head>`.
- **External CSS**: In a separate file (best practice).

### Example
```css
body {
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
}
h1 {
  color: darkblue;
}
```

### Box Model
- **Content**: The text or images inside an element.
- **Padding**: Space between content and border.
- **Border**: Outlines the padding.
- **Margin**: Space outside the border separating elements.

## 4. JavaScript: Adding Interactivity

JavaScript enables interactivity on web pages by allowing you to respond to user actions and manipulate HTML content dynamically.

### JavaScript Basics
- **Variables**: Store data (`let name = "Alex";`).
- **Functions**: Reusable blocks of code (`function greet() { alert("Hello"); }`).
- **Events**: User actions like clicks (`addEventListener("click", function)`).

### DOM Manipulation
- **Selecting Elements**: `document.getElementById("example")`
- **Changing Content**: `element.textContent = "New Text"`
- **Creating Elements**: `document.createElement("p")`

### Example
```javascript
document.getElementById("button").addEventListener("click", function() {
  alert("Button clicked!");
});
```

## Mini-Project: Building a Simple Profile Card

In this project, weâ€™ll combine HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive profile card.

### HTML Structure
```html
<div class="profile-card">
  <img src="profile-photo.jpg" alt="Profile Photo">
  <h2>Alex Johnson</h2>
  <p>Web Developer</p>
  <button id="toggle-info-btn">Show More</button>
  <div id="extra-info" style="display: none;">
    <p>Additional Info Here</p>
  </div>
</div>
```

### CSS Styling
```css
.profile-card {
  width: 300px;
  padding: 20px;
  background-color: #ffffff;
  border-radius: 10px;
  box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
}
```

### JavaScript Interactivity
```javascript
const toggleButton = document.getElementById("toggle-info-btn");
const extraInfo = document.getElementById("extra-info");

toggleButton.addEventListener("click", function() {
  if (extraInfo.style.display === "none") {
    extraInfo.style.display = "block";
    toggleButton.textContent = "Show Less";
  } else {
    extraInfo.style.display = "none";
    toggleButton.textContent = "Show More";
  }
});
```
